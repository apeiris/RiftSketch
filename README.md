RiftSketch is a web-based live coding environment for Virtual Reality.

It lets you code a "sketch" in JavaScript, using
[ThreeJS](http://threejs.org/), while the world around you changes immediately
as you code.

It's quite a niche application since you need to have a VR headset, be able to
touch-type, be a JavaScript programmer *and* be sufficiently familiar with 
Three.js but if you meet that criteria it's surprisingly fun and engaging!

## Features
- Live-coding with real-time scene updates
- Convenient keyboard shortcuts for incrementing numbers

## Setup
If you happen to have a VR headset with a WebXR compatible browser, try it by 
visiting http://brian.peiris.io/RiftSketch

## Development
```
$ npm ci
$ npm run start
```
